sidebar-Reader
==============

sidebar.io reader made with Angular.js

It is a sample project for me to practice Angular JS. Actually its a
styled RSS reader that only allows you to read sidebar.io

Todo:
-Responsive
-Fix dirty height hacks
-Fix dates
-Allow sharing/saving on social media
-Buy a domain :D
